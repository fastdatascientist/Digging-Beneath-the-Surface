    "[We're talking baseball!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZkpyZws4bJ8) Spring training games kicked off last week, and Opening Day is just around the corner. This blog entry will focus on the results from the 2017 regular season. We will use the runs scored (RS) and runs against (RA) for each team to predict their actual win totals. The two prediction methods that we'll focus on are Monte Carlo simulation and Bill James' Pythagorean Theorem of Baseball.\n",
